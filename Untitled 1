...
I want it to have a story
Start out as a very complex charachter (visually) every level you become more basic as well as the enviroment
Robot gets less complex over time

SOLO DOLO PT2 OMG!!!

Sidescroller or adventure.. not sure 

no enemies but hazards (not enough time for enemies)

enter image of screwdriver for howto screen!


Whats left to do:

Music for every level or every two levels or so
Cutscene between levels
Timer (include "scary" warning when time runs out)
EndGame
